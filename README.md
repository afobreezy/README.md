# Checkpoint Algorithms and its elements

##    Initialize sentCount, wordCount, and vowelCount to 0
##    Initialize sentence as a string with a maximum length of N
##    Initialize vowels as a string containing "aeiou"

##     IF sentence[i] is in vowels THEN Increment vowelCount by 1
##     IF sentence[i] is a space " " THEN Increment wordCount by 1
##     ELSE Increment sentCount by 1
